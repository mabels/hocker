  The Hocker the german-word for stool. So it's a tool of the couch(db) chain.
  Hocker give you a logical backup of a couchdb so the history and other 
  references will be destroyed. I wrote the programm to remove reference to 
  deleted documents which are not removed by the compaction. I have a database
  where around 30000 documents will be finaly in but in transit there are around 
  10Million documents in. These db was around 50times as big so i had to do something.
   
  How it works:

  off_hocker stores the content of a couchdb in a files suffixed with .hocker
  node off_hocker.js <couch-ip> <couch-port> [database-names]

  on_hocker stores the backup in the specified databases
  node on_hocker.js <couch-ip> <couch-port> [hocker-files]

  Feel free, there are some special extentions for demaged attaments which are
  appends on old couchdb version.
